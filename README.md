# Edge Detection Methods with Qt GUI

This C++ project, developed with the Qt library, provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for various edge detection methods. The implemented methods include:

1. **Sobel Operator:**
   - Utilizes convolution with Sobel kernels to highlight edges in both horizontal and vertical directions.

2. **Prewitt Operator:**
   - Similar to Sobel but uses a different convolution kernel to emphasize edges.

3. **Laplacian Operator:**
   - Involves the use of a Laplacian kernel to identify regions with rapid intensity changes, indicating potential edges.

4. **Canny Edge Detector:**
   - A multi-stage algorithm involving smoothing, gradient computation, non-maximum suppression, and edge tracking by hysteresis.

5. **Deriche Edge Detector:**
   - It is a multi-step algorithm employed to achieve optimal results in detecting edges within a discrete two-dimensional image.

## Usage

To use the edge detection methods with the GUI implemented in this Qt project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Qt-Edge-Detection.git
